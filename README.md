# OOP Design Patterns Workbook

This workbook contains all patterns described in "Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". My aim is to understand, remember and to use each of them in situations composed by myself. The workbook is going to have small code examples in text, written in TypeScript. Larger examples will be placed as code files in the "examples" folder.
